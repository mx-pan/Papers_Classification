Abstract(#br)Metabolic system modeling for model-based glycaemic control is becoming increasingly important. Few metabolic system models are clinically validated for both fit to the data and prediction ability. This research introduces a new additional form of pharmaco-dynamic (PD) surface comparison for model analysis and validation. These 3D surfaces are developed for 3 clinically validated models and 1 model with an added saturation dynamic. The models include the well-known Minimal Model. They are fit to two different data sets of clinical PD data from hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies at euglycaemia and/or hyperglycaemia. The models are fit to the first data set to determine an optimal set of population parameters. The second data set is used to test trend prediction of the surface modeling as it represents a lower insulin sensitivity cohort and should thus require only scaling in these (or related) parameters to match this data set. This particular approach clearly highlights differences in modeling methods, and the model dynamics utilized that may not appear as clearly in other fitting or prediction validation methods.(#br)Across all models saturation of insulin action is seen to be an important determinant of prediction and fit quality. In particular, the well-reported under-modeling of insulin sensitivity in the Minimal Model can be seen in this context to be a result of a lack of saturation dynamics, which in turn affects its ability to detect differences between cohorts. The overall approach of examining PD surfaces is seen to be an effective means of analyzing and thus validating a metabolic model's inherent dynamics and basic trend prediction on a population level, but is not a replacement for data driven, patient-specific fit and prediction validation for clinical use. The overall method presented could be readily generalized to similar PD systems and therapeutics.
