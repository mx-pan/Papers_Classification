Abstract More serious chattering emerges in discrete systems of sliding mode control. The paper presents a sliding mode-like fuzzy logic control design, which eliminates the chattering, for a class of discrete nonlinear systems with multiple variables. First, the boundary layer is self-tuned on-line, and then, the chattering free is obtained. Consequently, the fuzzy logic control (FLC) is designed to approximate the sliding mode control (SMC) with boundary layer self-tuning. Finally, the performance of the robustness, chattering free, and adaption are verified by the simulation results.
