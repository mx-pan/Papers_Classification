**摘要**
In this paper, we discuss anti-synchronization between two identical new chaotic systems and anti-synchronization between another two identical new chaotic systems by active nonlinear control. The sufficient conditions for achieving the anti-synchronization of two new chaotic systems are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations are provided for illustration and verification of the proposed method.
