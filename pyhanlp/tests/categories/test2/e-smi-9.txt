Abstract(#br)This paper presents the application of system identification techniques in the modeling of power system elements. In particular, the structural identification and initialization requirements for identifying a network model from the high-frequency response data of a laboratory network winding model which depicts an air-core reactor are investigated. The objective of the study is to show the step-by-step use of the system identification approach in identifying models for power system elements.
