**摘要**
The present invention relates to a method for building a building energy model by using a data-driven model, a building operating method using the same, and a system thereof. More specifically, the present invention provides a method for obtaining a precise and effective approximation model and estimation model by filtering more precise data by applying a random sample consensus (RANSAC) technique when building the building energy model using a Gaussian process.
