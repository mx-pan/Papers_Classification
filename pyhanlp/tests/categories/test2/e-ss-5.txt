**摘要**
We present a Web-based knowledge management and decision support system for Type I Diabetes patients' care. The tool exploits the integration of two methodologies, Case Based Reasoning and Rule Based Reasoning, and supports physicians in the definition of therapeutic strategies. Such a work is being integrated in the EU funded T-IDDM project architecture. In this paper we report a first evaluation obtained on simulated patients.
