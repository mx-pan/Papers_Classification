Abstract(#br)Data-driven soft sensor is an effective solution to provide rapid and reliable estimations for key quality variables online. The secondary variables affect the primary variable in considerably different speed, and soft sensor systems exhibit multi-dynamic characteristics. Thus, the first contribution is improving the model in the previous study with multi-time-constant. The characteristics-separation-based model will be identified in substep way, and the stochastic Newton recursive (SNR) algorithm is adopted. Considering the dual-rate characteristics of soft sensor systems, the proposed model cannot be identified directly. Thus, two auxiliary models are first proposed to offer the intersample estimations at each update period, based on which the improved algorithm (DAM-SNR) is derived. These two auxiliary models function in switching mechanism which has been illustrated in detail. This algorithm serves for the identification of the proposed model together with the SNR algorithm, and the identification procedure is then presented. Finally, the laboratorial case confirms the effectiveness of the proposed soft sensor model and the algorithms.
