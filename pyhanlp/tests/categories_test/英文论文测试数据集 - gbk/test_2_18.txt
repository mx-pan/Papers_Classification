**摘要**
Hybrid testing method of dynamically substructured system is used for performance evaluation of engineering systems. During the tests, an entire engineering system is decomposed into software simulation and physical hardware substructures. Linear and well-understood parts are simulated numerically, and uncertain specimens are tested physically. The success of the tests relies on a high-quality controller to cancel the unwanted dynamics introduced by actuators within the physical substructures, thus synchronizing the numerical and physical responses at the interface. Delay compensation techniques are commonly used in dealing with the substructuring control issues. This paper proposes a new direct-compensation strategy to define the initial condition of an adaptive delay-prediction controller, without using a priori information about the tested components parameters. Meanwhile, singular value decomposition method is applied to the control synthesis procedure, in order to reduce the numerical sensitivity of the controller, providing with the possibility of achieving a high-level accuracy of the tests. Experimental results are included, which favorably verify the proposed improvement strategies.
