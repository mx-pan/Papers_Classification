**摘要**
This paper investigates controllability of higher order switched Boolean control networks (SBCNs). First, by using semi-tensor product (STP) method, two algebraic forms of higher order SBCNs are derived. And a necessary and sufficient condition of controllability for higher order SBCNs is obtained. Then based on the second algebraic form, the corresponding control and switching-law which drive a point to a given reachable point are designed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the validity of the main result.
