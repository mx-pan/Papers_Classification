**摘要**
We consider a problem of maximization of the distance traveled by a material point in the presence of a nonlinear friction under a bounded thrust and fuel expenditure. Using the maximum principle we obtain the form of optimal control and establish conditions under which it contains a singular subarc. This problem seems to be the simplest one having a mechanical sense in which singular subarcs appear in a nontrivial way.
