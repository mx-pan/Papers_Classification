**摘要**
This paper presents an angular velocity estimation method based on optical flow to address the hovering and angle tracking control problem for a three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) lab helicopter. An analytical expression of the travel angular velocity is deduced based on optical flow. Then, a controller consisting of a feedforward controller and a linear quadratic regulation (LQR) state feedback controller is designed. Experiment results on the lab helicopter demonstrate the validity of the angular velocity estimation method and the LQR control strategy.
