**摘要**
This paper presents a tracking control scheme for positioning of piezo-actuated stage under hysteresis effect. The hysteresis is estimated by an nonlinear observer and is compensated via feedforward control. Sliding mode controller is employed as a feedback control to track the reference. Exper- imental results showed effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
