**摘要**
A numerical scheme is formulated for approximating the dynamic behavior of a reparable multi-state device, which can be described as a distributed parameter system of coupled partial and ordinary hybrid equations. The convergence issues are established by applying the Trotter-Kato Theorem, and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
