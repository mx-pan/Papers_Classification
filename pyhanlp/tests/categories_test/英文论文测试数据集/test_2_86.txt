**摘要**
In current literature, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially quadrotors, is one of the hot topics of study which has numerous applications. This paper focuses on modeling the quadrotor in order to improve the empirical results. The procedure consists of four stages: 1) Experimental determination of controller coefficients, 2) Data collection, 3) System identification, 4) Controller redesign. After these stages, it is observed that the system is capable of stabilize on the roll, pitch and yaw axes. Coefficient tuning on the identified model noticeably improves the settling time and steady state oscillation amplitude. ? 2013 IEEE.
